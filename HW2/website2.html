	<h2 class="headings">What is <em>"clarinet"</em> ?</h2>
	<p class="introduction">The clarinet is a musical instrument in the woodwind family. The instrument has a nearly cylindrical bore and a flared bell, and uses a single reed to produce sound.<br>

	Clarinets comprise a family of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. The clarinet family is the largest such woodwind family, with more than a dozen types, ranging from the BB♭ contrabass to the E♭ soprano. The most common clarinet is the B♭ soprano clarinet.<br>

	German instrument maker Johann Christoph Denner is generally credited with inventing the clarinet sometime after 1698 by adding a register key to the chalumeau, an earlier single-reed instrument. Over time, additional keywork and the development of airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability. Today the clarinet is used in classical music, military bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles. It is a standard fixture of the orchestra, concert band and big band.</p>


	<h2 class="headings">Why is it called <em>"clarinet"</em> ?</h2>
	<p class="introduction">The word clarinet may have entered the English language via the French clarinette (the feminine diminutive of Old French clarin), or from <em>Provençal clarin </em>("oboe").It is ultimately from the Latin root <em>clarus</em> ("clear"). The word is related to Middle English clarion, a type of trumpet, the name of which derives from the same root.<br>

	The earliest mention of the word clarinette as used for the instrument dates to a 1710 order placed by the Duke of Gronsfeld for two of the instrument made by Jacob Denner. The English form clarinet is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic clarionet appears from 1784 until the early 20th century.<br>
	
	A person who plays the clarinet is called a clarinetist (in North American English), a clarinettist (in British English), or simply a clarinet player.</p>
